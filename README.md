## <ins>About Me</ins>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I’m Kevin Hewitt, a Full-Stack Developer with a Bachelor’s Degree in IT. I’m skilled in several languages and have vast experience in Web Development and Data Analytics. I started at Time Warner Cable, as a Report Specialist building solutions in MS Office, SQL, PowerBI, and Crystal Reports and later transitioned to the Video Repair GVP Operations group. As a Business Analyst, I developed various solutions on the same platforms and others such as Tableau, SSRS, SSIS, and Web. I also conducted In-Depth, Forecasting, Ad-Hoc, and recurring Analyses on employee and queue performance.  My work earned me many awards and high remarks, both inside and outside of my teams. My goal is to continue doing what I love. In my free time, I enjoy watching TV and exploring new code libraries.
